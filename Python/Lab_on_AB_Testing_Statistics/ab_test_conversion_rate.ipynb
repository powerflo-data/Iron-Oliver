    "You work for Company K. Company K is a video streaming service that is selling subscriptions. After running a few analyses, you suggest to the Product Team that placing more prominent upsells on the landing page may result in higher conversion rates (visitors signing up for the subscription). The Product Team took your suggestion with excitement and the engineering team went ahead and implemented the experiment right away. \n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment ran for the month of February 2020. You prepared a few datasets beforehand that will help you in analyzing the success of the A/B test.\n",
    "The A/B test had two experiment groups, A & B, in which visitors assigned to A were in the control group and visitors assigned to B received the new variant with the new upsells. You suggest to assign approximately 7% of the daily visitors to the experiment, applying a 50/50 split among the two variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have the following datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `first_pageviews`: This is a summary of all the unsubscribed users and the timestamp of their first pageview. Users get assigned according to their cookies, which is how we make sure that a user may not be assigned to two different groups when they reach our landing page. Since visitors haven't signed up at this point, they don't have a `user_id`, instead, we assign them a random but unique `anonymous_id`. If visitors get assigned to an experiment, you should see a non-null value in the `exp_id` column. Your experiment has the ids **101** for control and **102** for the variant.\n",
    "2. `subscribers`: This table shows you which users have subscribed at what point in time. To subscribe, you need to be a registered user, which is how you can uniquely identify each subscriber. Since we only sell yearly subscriptions, users cannot have more than 1 subscription within 365 days. \n",
    "3. `users`: This table is useful to link the first pageview of unsubscribed visitors to our subscribers. It keeps track of the `anonymous_id` we assigned to them and maps to the `user_id` we assigned after they sign up\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediately after the end of the experiment, the Product Manager approaches you overly excited and wants you to analyze the success of the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the datasets in the `data/2020-03-01` folder."
